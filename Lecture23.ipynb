    "It does not help to know the initial position and velocity for the points, if we are not using the velocity in our numerical solution.\n",
    "The trick is to incorporate the initial velocity condition (like $v(0)=0$) into the first few values of the position at time step $j$.\n",
    "Since the velocity is a time derivative, we can write it in terms of a central-difference equation, and set it to 0 for the initial condition:\n",
